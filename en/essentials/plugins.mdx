## Installing Django Plugins

To install a Django plugin, such as the Payment Plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Django is Installed**: Make sure Django is installed in your environment.

2. **Obtain the Plugin**: Clone the repository or download the plugin files.

3. **Add to Plugins Folder**: Move the plugin files into the `plugins` folder of the `ruoom-core` repository.

4. **Update Django Settings**: Add the plugin to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings. For example, for the Payment Plugin, add `'plugins.payment'`.

5. **Run Migrations**: Execute the following command to set up the necessary database tables for the plugin:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate <plugin_name>
   ```

Replace `<plugin_name>` with the actual name of the plugin you are installing.

6. **Verify Installation**: Check your Django admin panel to ensure the plugin appears and is functioning as expected.

For specific configuration details, refer to the plugin's README or documentation.
