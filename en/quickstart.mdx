## Quickstart Guide for Ruoom Core

Welcome to Ruoom Core! Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start using Ruoom Core. For a visual walkthrough, check out our [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPwiajnBf0).

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Ruoom Core repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ruoom-core.git
   cd ruoom-core
   ```

2. **Create PostgreSQL Database**: Create a PostgreSQL database called "Ruoom" owned by a user named "ruoom_admin" with the password "password". You can do this manually using PGAdmin or using the following SQL commands:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE Ruoom;
   CREATE USER ruoom_admin WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   ALTER DATABASE Ruoom OWNER TO ruoom_admin;
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**: Install all necessary dependencies using the requirements file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database**: Set up PostgreSQL with a database called "Ruoom", a user called "ruoom_admin", and password "password". Then, run the following command to apply migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**: Start the local development server to see Ruoom Core in action.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You can now access the application at `localhost:8000`. You should be met with the following page that allows you to create your admin credentials:
