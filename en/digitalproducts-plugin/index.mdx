## Welcome to the Digital Products Plugin

The Digital Products Plugin is a versatile tool within the Ruoom ecosystem, designed to facilitate the sale of digital products such as meetings, downloads, and more. It integrates seamlessly with Ruoom Core to provide a comprehensive digital sales solution.

The Digital Products Plugin is best utilized in conjunction with the Payment Plugin to enable a full-featured paywall and transaction processing system.

For this plugin, a "Digital Product" is defined as a resource or service that can be provided to your customers in the form of a link (which may be a download link, a meeting link, or anything else), and optionally a password.

For each digital product, Ruoom will auto-generate a unique checkout URL to direct your customers to and purchase the product. This can be added to your website as a button, or even embedded on your website directly.
