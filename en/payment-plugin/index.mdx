## Welcome to the Payment Plugin

The Payment Plugin is an integral part of the Ruoom ecosystem, designed to facilitate secure and efficient payment processing. It integrates seamlessly with Ruoom Core to provide a comprehensive payment solution.

The Payment Plugin does not in itself contain features that can be purchased - rather it is a supporting plugin enabling the purchase of items using other plugins.

For the simplest paywall solution provided by Ruoom, couple the Payment Plugin with the Digital Products plugin!
